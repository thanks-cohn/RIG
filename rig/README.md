# RIG

RIG is a Rust crate that brings Zig-style allocator visibility to everyday Rust code.

Rust keeps doing the safety work: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and type checking are still handled by normal Rust. RIG does not replace the compiler, invent a programming language, or implement custom allocator internals. It makes allocation and growth behavior visible at the container level so developers can see what grows over time.

## What v0.3.0 proves

RIG v0.3.0 is intentionally small and real:

- `Arena` gives a human-readable name to a tracking scope.
- `RigVec<T>` wraps a real `Vec<T>`.
- `RigString` wraps a real `String`.
- `push`, `push_str`, `len`, `is_empty`, and `capacity` behave like normal Rust container operations.
- Capacity growth events, total pushed items, append operations, and appended bytes are tracked.
- `arena.report()` produces live allocation/growth data from tracked containers.
- `arena.snapshot()` returns typed machine-readable report data.
- `arena.report_json()` serializes that snapshot with real `serde_json`.

## Example

```rust
use rig::{Arena, RigVec};

let mut arena = Arena::new("request-lifetime arena");
let mut users = RigVec::new(&mut arena, "users");

users.push(1);
users.push(2);

println!("{}", arena.report());
```

Output includes the arena name, container name, current length, capacity, growth events, and total pushed/appended operations.

## Machine-readable reports

RIG keeps the existing human report and adds structured report data for tools.

```rust
let snapshot = arena.snapshot();
let json = arena.report_json();
```

`arena.snapshot()` returns an `ArenaReport` with the arena name, tracked container count, aggregate totals, and per-container evidence. `arena.report_json()` pretty-prints the same data through `serde_json::to_string_pretty(&self.snapshot())`, using the real crates.io `serde` and `serde_json` crates.

Small JSON example:

```json
{
  "arena_name": "request-lifetime arena",
  "tracked_container_count": 1,
  "totals": {
    "total_len": 2,
    "total_current_capacity": 4,
    "total_growth_events": 0,
    "total_pushed_appended_operations": 2
  },
  "containers": [
    {
      "name": "users",
      "kind": "RigVec",
      "len": 2,
      "initial_capacity": 4,
      "current_capacity": 4,
      "growth_events": 0,
      "operation_label": "total pushed items",
      "total_operations": 2,
      "extra_metric_label": null,
      "extra_metric_value": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Run the demo

```bash
cargo run --example demo
```

The v0.3.0 demo creates tracked vectors and strings, then prints the readable report, a blank line, and the JSON report.

```text
Rust is still safe, but allocation and growth behavior is now visible.

## What RIG is not

RIG is not:

- a new programming language
- a garbage collector
- a framework
- compiler work
- a macro system
- custom allocator internals

## Smoke tests that matter in v0.3.0

The v0.3.0 smoke tests prove real capability:

- arenas can be named and reported
- tracked vectors and strings start empty and remain usable as normal Rust containers
- pushes update length and total pushed item counts
- string appends update length, append operation counts, and appended byte counts
- capacity increases record growth events
- multiple containers can report through one arena
- empty container reports still contain valid allocation/growth fields
- reports preserve exact readable indentation for totals, containers, and fields
- snapshots contain arena names, tracked container counts, totals, container kinds, capacity, and growth evidence
- JSON reports parse with real `serde_json` and round-trip into `ArenaReport`
- the repository does not contain a fake `vendor/` dependency tree
